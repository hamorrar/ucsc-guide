## Summary

This group of articles will take you through what version control is, why it is useful, what it has to do with Git, and the basics of Git. It's okay if you don't understand everything the first time reading these articles. Read it once or twice and come back to them as you're reading [Basic Git Operations](https://hilalmorrar.com/ucsc-guide/majorguides/computerscience/git/basics/basic_git_operations/) as necessary.
