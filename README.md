## **A guide for prospective and current UCSC students.**

We believe that we can improve our current circumstances if we pay it forward. We hope that this guide will serve as a tool to teach people what we as contributors, know or wish we knew before entering UCSC.

## Project Scope

The project is intended to encompass every aspect of being a student at UCSC with the hopes of other schools following these footsteps and making a similar guide for their school.
