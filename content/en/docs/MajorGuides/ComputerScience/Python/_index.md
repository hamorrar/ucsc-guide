  Comprehensive python guide for CSE20 and CSE30.

Python is the first language of choice for many CS courses. As a UCSC student, this is no different. The material and topics covered in this guide will show up numerous times in other lower division and upper division courses, so it would be my advice to take away as much as possible from these classes and this guide. Doing so will ensure not only a more pleasant experience in this class but your computer science journey in general.
