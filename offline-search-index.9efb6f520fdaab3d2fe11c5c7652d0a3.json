[{"body":"Hello! Welcome to UCSC and the Unofficial Student Guide! Congratulations on your admission and enrollment at UC Santa Cruz!\nFor New/Prospective Students This guide serves to introduce new students to UCSC student life through tips and experiences shared from experienced fellow UCSC peers. I find that many UCSC sites are hard to navigate and not incredibly informative since they lack student opinions, so this guide will complement much of the important information from the UCSC sites with student perspectives and thoughts to give new students a more realistic and wholistic introduction to UCSC.\n For Current/Returning Students Some of the information in The Guide may already be known to you and some of it may not. If you find something wrong/incorrect or would like to add more information, please let me know or see the Contribution Guide if you would like to try making a fix yourself!\n Site Navigation and Use There is a navigation bar on the left-hand side that will categorize all the different sections of The Guide, ranging from off campus housing to preparation for your major studies to student employment. I will put as many relevant links from UCSC sites as I can throughout The Guide so you can always trace back this summarized information to the source to verify its authenticity.\nThe right side of each page will have links to the different subsections of that page for easy access to particular information you are looking for or just to act as a summary of what the current page has.\nThe bottom of each page will have a link to the next section if you want to read and click through in order, but you can pick and choose any section from the navigation bar - order doesn’t matter. The time this site was last updated will also be on the bottom of each page, so you know how up-to-date the information is.\nI will try to put up as many preparation guide for as many majors as I can but I am a Computer Science major, so my expertise in other fields is not good enough to know how to make an appropriate guide for other programs of study. So I will contact other students and department advising offices to put something together. This will be something along the lines of a “Things I wish I knew before starting [Your Major] at UCSC”.\nThere will also be more general UCSC student information in addition to specific majors and programs, such as dining hall, On/off campus housing, residential colleges, and financial aid guides too.\n Personal Notes \u0026 Disclaimer I will do my best to keep it concise, so this guide can be a regular and quick reference for you during your studies at UCSC! This is in no way affiliated with UC Santa Cruz, The Regents, or The University of California.\n","categories":"","description":"Start your journey through the guide here.\n","excerpt":"Start your journey through the guide here.\n","ref":"/ucsc-guide/docs/","tags":"","title":"How To Use This Guide"},{"body":"I got a house close to the base of campus in Summer 2020 and this is an approximate sequence of events and resources I found (but not necessarily used) to help get a place to live.\n Picking Your Group UCSC Community Rentals - Before You Rent\nThe most important thing I would do before even starting to look for a house is to find a solid group of people to live with. Personally, I think a group of 3 - 5 people is a great middle ground for house cleanliness and fun but also somewhat private and quiet to study. Make sure you talk about everyone’s preferences, living condition/way of living, and price ranges. It is very competitive to find housing in Santa Cruz, so you want to pick a solid group who can communicate and be ready to apply to maximize chances of getting the house. You should be doing this around February.\n Starting Your Search After you have your group picked out, have everyone in the group start searching any and all websites for house listings that match the group’s preferences, while simulateously filling out a renter’s application packet. Some landlords ask for it and some don’t, but it takes a little while to put together, so start early. See the link above for more information on it. This also the time to take the quick Canvas Renter’s Workshop. Some landlords ask that you complete it and show the certificate of completion (mine did), but even if they don’t ask, there is still some good information in there about off campus housing in general. You should be doing this in February - March.\n Links for Your Search Here is a list of sites to search for (in no particular order, not exhaustive):\n Zillow (this is where I found my house) Apartments.com Realtor.com Craigslist Santa Cruz Housing Facebook Public Group UCSC Housing, Sublets \u0026 Roommates Facebook Private Group University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Housing, Sublets \u0026 Roommates Facebook Private Group   Contacting Potential Landlords Keep searching all the sites you can and when you reach out to landlord via email or text (however they prefer), I would recommend only having one person communicating with the landlord and then they will convey the updates to the rest of the group - it is usually much more oragnized and less confusing to keep track of who is talking to who. You should be doing this starting in March - April.\nWhen you first contact a landlord to express interest in their listing, I recommend you do the following:\n quickly introduce yourself and your group - names, majors, year express interest in that specific listing - give the address of the place so they know which one in case they have more than one try to sell yourself and your group a little - make yourselves sound like good tenants (and make sure that is the reality too) ask about availability for a tour, applying, and signing the lease so they can get a feel that you are serious about securing this house.  Keep this initial email/text with the landlord SHORT. Get to the point - housing is competitive in Santa Cruz, so you don’t want to deter landlords with a long essay. Make it easier for them.\n Note: This process of searching for potential houses and contacting landlords usually takes a while, so be patient and keep searching. Many landlords will ghost you, leave you on read, or take a while to reply. Don’t take it personal and just move on to the next.\n Pay attention to the date the house is available for new tenants if it is mentioned in the listing online. If it isn’t online you can ask about it in the initial email, but it will be in the lease. I prefer a start date/time that is anytime outside the school year in case my group doesn’t want to resign for another year or we get kicked out, we won’t be doing this whole process again while taking classes. Most leases are 12 months long, so you will be paying for the summer months rent anyway, but you can ask for a month to month lease or a term shorter than 12 months (although landlords do not prefer this).\n Reading the Lease After engaging in talks with landlord and you seem to have a place that will be yours, the landlord will send you the lease and give you a little bit of time to read and sign it. Please read the lease completely.\n Note: Look for contradictions, unfair rules, things that stand out or don’t make sense, and ask for clarification. Make sure you, your group, and the landlord are all in agreement about the terms of the lease BEFORE signing. If you don’t read the whole thing, then at the very least, read the first couple pages since that is where the main points are usually.\n  Move In and Things to Set Up Next is to pay your (refundable) safety deposit, get the keys, and move in! Congratulations! Some houses are prefunished, but I would say most are not. So figure out if anything comes with the house and fill in the missing furniture or appliances with your group.\nRead the terms of your lease to remember what utilities (PG\u0026E, water, trash, cable/internet) you are and not responsible for paying and get those set up. I would say that usually one person takes responsiblilty to pay for one utility to make it fair and everyone pays them back.\n Note: start setting up the utilities (especially internet) as soon as you get the keys to make sure you have a smooth start.\n Be a good housemate, roommate, neighbor, and tenant. It isn’t technically your house, but you should be treating as if it is (or risk losing a lot of your safety deposit)!\n More resources  Community Rentals - (ucsc site) has many more links and resources to help Places4Students - place to find rentals and housemates Legal Services \u0026 Consulation - free access to an attorney for UCSC students if you have legal concerns regarding off campus housing (offered via UCSC Dean of Students) Community Rentals - Questions to Ask - questions to ask the landlord  ","categories":"","description":"How and when to secure a house or apartment off campus.\n","excerpt":"How and when to secure a house or apartment off campus.\n","ref":"/ucsc-guide/docs/housing/offcampus/houseapartment/","tags":"","title":"Off Campus Housing"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Off Campus but through UCSC housing in downtown Santa Cruz.\n","excerpt":"Off Campus but through UCSC housing in downtown Santa Cruz.\n","ref":"/ucsc-guide/docs/housing/offcampus/utc/","tags":"","title":"University Town Center"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Your guide to on and off campus housing.\n","excerpt":"Your guide to on and off campus housing.\n","ref":"/ucsc-guide/docs/housing/","tags":"","title":"Housing"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Your guide to off campus housing.\n","excerpt":"Your guide to off campus housing.\n","ref":"/ucsc-guide/docs/housing/offcampus/","tags":"","title":"Off Campus Housing"},{"body":"The 10 Colleges are listed below in order of when they were founded from first to most recent.

All experience levels are welcome! Please take a look at ./HELPWANTED.md to see items that are outside of the current team’s expertise that need help to expand the scope of the project.\nThe Unofficial UCSC Student Guide is an open source project and welcome to patches, contributions, and improvements!\nContributing to The Unofficial UCSC Student Guide The Guide lives on GitHub. You can view all of its source code there.\nFor those inexperienced with programming: Create an Issue If there’s something you’d like to see in The Guide (or if you’ve found something that isn’t working the way you’d expect), but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue or contact Hilal via email (hamorrar@ucsc.edu) or Discord (hmorrar#1632).\n For those experienced with programming: Initial Setup The guide uses the extended version of hugo with the Docsy theme.\n Install Git. Install Node (and its dependencies if on Windows). Download and install the extended version of Hugo (linked above). Fork the repository on GitHub. Use the recursive tag when cloning your fork so that all the submodules are also downloaded: git clone --recursive git@github.com:hamorrar/ucsc-guide.git cd ucsc-guide to navigate into the project. Install all the dependencies: npm install Use the hugo serve or hugo server command to start the server. Open a browser and go to https://localhost:1313/ucsc-guide.  Notes for Hugo Development The repository looks a bit intimidating at first but most of it is all set up from Hugo initially and I fixed it up so most of the work will be done in the ./content/en/docs directory to write up articles in Markdown. Also when previewing changes locally, be careful of the draft value in the top of the Markdown file you are working in. If it is set to true it will not show up in the final build, but it will show up in a preview only if you use the -D flag in when starting the local server. Every article page you want to write has to have those preamble lines (Hugo calls it “front matter”) at the top for it to render correctly (or at all). You can copy and paste from another file and modify the appropriate fields.\n title is the title of the article linkTitle is what will show up in the left navigation bar weight is for ordering the pages in the directory for the left navigation bar icon is if you want to put an emote next to the title in the left navigation bar from Font Awesome draft is to publish the file on the site if it is in the main branch (false - not a draft. true - is a draft) description is a quick one line summary/preview/subtitle for the article to display under the main title on the page  Create a Pull Request and Preview Locally Continue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.
